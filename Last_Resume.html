            Work Experience
          </h2>
         <p>
           As a highschooler the most "work" experience I can get is  going to field trips and hearing guest speakers talk about their own work experience. These opportunites let me hear about their stories and get an idea of what I will want to do in the future. The engineering academy has also given me the opportunity to partcipate in its mentor program and has allowed me to gain some first hand knowledge from those directly involved in the work force. 
           <br> 
           <br>
          A field trip that really stood out to me was my trip to the Patriot Jet Team Foundation with the Engineering Academy in Dublin High. It was inspiring to meet and talk to veteran aircraft engineers and pilots that were so passionate about their career. The mixture of stories, lessong and exploration allowed me to learn the basic science of how jets work and see a handful of working jets. 
          <br> <br>
           A group of influential speakers that really spoke to me was a group from an engineering firm that focused heavily on material engineering. These speakers communicated clearly on what was expected inside of their career. It was fascinating to learn different techniques for how foundations are placed and materials are selected for different projects.
           <br><br>
           The mentor meeting that I have been partaking in with the Engineering Academy in Dublin High School has given me so much knowledge that I would have never learned about outside of school. I've learned about interviewing skills and tips, what to expect inside of college and what it's actually like working. It's been so interesting being able to hear from the wide range of backgrounds that all the mentors have come from.
