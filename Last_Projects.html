               The problem was to design and build a winch that was able to lift 100 grams at least 30 centimeters over the side of a table. The parts that would be used were either Fishertek or VEX parts. The motor had to be Fishertek and had to have an on and off switch. A netlogo program was also needed to simulate the winch.
               <br><br>
               In this project, I had a huge impact with the designing and physical building of the winch. I did a majority of the designing, while my partner and I equally assembled the parts.

                The problem of this project was to use the Westpoint bridge designer software to design and test a bridge that is both stable and cost efficient. This meant that research had to be done, and different member and joint placements were played around with. Not only that, but the materials and widths of the members were also changeable. 
                <br>
                <br>
                For this project, I created 2 prototype bridges that were both cost efficient and stable. I spent multiple classes figuring out a bridge that I thought worked the best. Not only this but I covered a majority of the documentation and background research.

                The problem of this project was to create your own online portfolio that followed the basic outlines given. This meant that certain content was done, but there was freedom in design. In order to do this, lots of research had to be done in order to figure out how to code what you want to create. 
                <br>
                <br>
                For this project, I created a majority of this webiste from scratch. I spent multiple classes figuring out how to code the different layouts of the website and how to work the css. Not only this but I had to write all of the content of the portfolio's different pages.

                The problem of this project was to use Scratch website to create a game or story that the player could interact with and change the outcome. This meant that ideas had to be brainstormed, and team members had to work efficiently together to create a fun project. My team eventually chose to create a turn based combat game. 
                <br>
                <br>
                For this project, I created the code for the core of the game. I spent multiple classes figuring out how to code the desired game and eventually adding new features. Not only this but I helped draw the backgrounds.

                The problem of this project was to create a control system that utilized AOI Logic. It was necessary to have each person create a part of the circuit by making a truth table, the equation and then simplifying it down. Once that was done, the multisim simulation could be finished and breadboarding would be started. It was all combined at the end. 
                <br>
                <br>
                For this project, I created the Covid 19 section of the circuit. I spent a large amount of time creating a truth table with 256 different combinations and an equation with 16 minterms. I was able to take out/simplify around 30-40 gates yet it was still huge. Next I moved on to the multisim and took advantage of the fact that I could share the inverters' outputs and utilize XOR gates to make it even simpler. I was then able to create the circuit in parts on the breadboard.

                The problem of this project was to create an artistic design using the PLD and a logic converter. There had to be documention with a design brief, display definitions, truth table, logic expressions and then the multisim/assembled circuit. 
                <br>
                <br>
                For this project, I created an LED display that could be featured on an electronic game by a company like Hasbro. I first came up with the pattern the LEDs were going to be in, the order they would flash, then the truth table and equations using the logic converter. After that, I was able to create the circuit simulation and assemble the actual circuit. The lights would flash to the right, then to the left, and finally towards the middle.
