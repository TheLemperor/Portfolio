               The problem was to design and build a winch that was able to lift 100 grams at least 30 centimeters over the side of a table. The parts that would be used were either Fishertek or VEX parts. The motor had to be Fishertek and had to have an on and off switch. A netlogo program was also needed to simulate the winch.
               <br><br>
               In this project, I had a huge impact with the designing and physical building of the winch. I did a majority of the designing, while my partner and I equally assembled the parts.

                The problem of this project was to use the Westpoint bridge designer software to design and test a bridge that is both stable and cost efficient. This meant that research had to be done, and different member and joint placements were played around with. Not only that, but the materials and widths of the members were also changeable. 
                <br>
                <br>
                For this project, I created 2 prototype bridges that were both cost efficient and stable. I spent multiple classes figuring out a bridge that I thought worked the best. Not only this but I covered a majority of the documentation and background research.

                The problem of this project was to create your own online portfolio that followed the basic outlines given. This meant that certain content was done, but there was freedom in design. In order to do this, lots of research had to be done in order to figure out how to code what you want to create. 
                <br>
                <br>
                For this project, I created a majority of this webiste from scratch. I spent multiple classes figuring out how to code the different layouts of the website and how to work the css. Not only this but I had to write all of the content of the portfolio's different pages.

                The problem of this project was to use Scratch website to create a game or story that the player could interact with and change the outcome. This meant that ideas had to be brainstormed, and team members had to work efficiently together to create a fun project. My team eventually chose to create a turn based combat game. 
                <br>
                <br>
                For this project, I created the code for the core of the game. I spent multiple classes figuring out how to code the desired game and eventually adding new features. Not only this but I helped draw the backgrounds.
