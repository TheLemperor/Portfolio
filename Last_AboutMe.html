              <p>
                Working as an engineer isn't even working when I'm having as much fun as possible. My goal in career life isn't just the stereotypical "make my own company" or the "make as much money as possible" kind of goals. Instead my goal in this future life is to find an area of work that I truly enjoy. When I enjoy my work, I'll naturally work as indigently as possible. I'll live a very enjoyable life while also getting payed a lump sum for doing my hobbies. The POE and CSP classes have helped me explore the different sides of engineering and helped me discover my passion for engineering.
                <br><br>
                As an engineer in training, I love designing and making random items. Growing up, I would always be found taping paper together and making 3d structures, or putting pencils together to make a sword. I've made little catapults, rubber band guns, coin launching devices and lots of other working machines out of materials that could be found on a desk. I'm also part of a team competing in a tournament called Odyssey of the Mind. Odyssey of the Mind focuses on challenging the teams' creativity, acting, and engineering skills. It has several different problems every year, and requires the teams to solve them in a unique and out of the box way.
