              <p>
                Working as an engineer is not even working when I am having as much fun as I currently am. My career goal in life is not just the stereotypical "make my own company" or the "make as much money as possible" kind of goals, but rather it is to find an area of work that I truly enjoy. When this happens, I will naturally work as diligently as I possibly can and live an enjoyable life while getting payed a lump sum for doing my hobbies. The Principles of Engineering, Computer Science Principles and Digital Electronic classes have helped me explore the different sides of engineering and assisted in discovering my passion for engineering. I've been able to learn HTML, CSS and Python, and am currently learning how to design and assemble circuits. 
                <br><br>
                As an engineer in training, I love designing and making random items. Growing up, I would always be found taping paper together and making 3d structures, or putting pencils together to make a sword. I have made little catapults, rubber band guns, coin launching devices and lots of other working machines out of materials that could be found on a desk. This still continues today, as I am enthusiastic to make things with my 3D Printer and other electronics/materials. 
                <br><br>
                I am president of the badminton club, and captain/officer of the Varsity Badminton team with lots of success during the season. I also help coach a team from my middle school competing in a tournament called Odyssey of the Mind. It focuses on challenging the teams' creativity, acting, and engineering skills. Through these opportunites, I've been able to practice my leadership/communication skills while doing things that I have a passion for.
                <br><br>
                Thank you for checking the About Me page and I welcome you to check out the rest of my site.
